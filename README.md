## Original project development setup

Set up MySQL server on your personal computer and run the database.sql file in
originalDevSetup. Set up PHP on your computer if you do not already have it.

Once the database is constructed, cd into the originalDevSetup directory and
run:

`php -S localhost:8000`

Once the server is running, navigate to the link output to your terminal. You
should be able to use the application without issue. If the database name or
port is different, you will need to change the corresponding links in all
of the files.
